#  ZERO KNOWLEDGE MATH

## 	This repository has all my learnings on the math necessary for Zero Knowledge Proofs.

##### Context for Zero Knowledge:

​	"Human diginity demands that personal information, like medical and foresnic data, be hidden from the public. But veils of secrecy designed to preserve privacy may also be abused to cover up lies and deceit by institutions entrusted with data, unjustly harming citizens and eroding trust inc entral institutions" -- Starkware.

What is a Zero Knowledge Proof?

​	A Zero knowledge Proof is a cryptographic method by which one party called the prover can convince another party called the verifier that the statement is true, without revealing any additional information beyond the validity of the statement itself.

Prover : The **Prover** is the party usually an alogiorithm or a program that possess some secret information and that information is called as **Witness** and want to prove the knowledge of this secret or the validity of a statement to another party.

Verifier : The **Verifier** is a party that can be a program, protocol or smart contract that checks the proof send by the prover and decides whether to accept or reject it.
